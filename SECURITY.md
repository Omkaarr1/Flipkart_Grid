### 2. Code Security

- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices, including input validation, proper error handling, and avoiding the use of insecure functions.
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities using tools like `Dependabot` or `Snyk`.
- **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other team member to catch potential security issues.

### 3. API Security

- **Authentication**: Ensure that any API endpoints requiring access to sensitive data or functions are secured with proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and abuse of API endpoints.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging for critical actions and monitor for unusual activity.

### 4. Infrastructure Security

- **Server Security**: Regularly update the server and environment to the latest security patches. Use firewalls and secure configurations to protect the server.
